  - question: Why are you rooting for world peace?
    answer: I was born in Beirut (1980) during the Civil War. My parents left for Paris in 1983 because I couldn't sleep anymore. I suffered deeply from war and its consequences. That's why I would like to imagine a world without it. Competition, yes. War, no thanks.
  - question: Is blogging your only occupation?
    answer: No, of course not. I'm writing a novel about my experience that should be out in 6 months if everything goes well. I also love music and was contacted by a record label to produce some of my tracks.
  - question: How do I contribute to the blog?
    answer: To contribute, you must have decent written English skills and have life experience on a subject to provide solutions. Send me a message through the contact page with a link to your finest work.
  - question: How many posts have you written?
    answer: I started the blog in October 2017 and wrote 300 articles during 2 years and a half. Then I took a 1 year break to learn web development and this website is the result of my hard work. This year I will migrate all posts from the old website to this one. Be patient!
