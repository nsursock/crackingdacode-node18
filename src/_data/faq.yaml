  - question: What is the underlying reason for your support of global peace?
    answer: I was born in Beirut in 1980, a tumultuous period marked by the Civil War. In 1983, my parents made the difficult decision to relocate to Paris due to the incessant turmoil, as it rendered a peaceful existence impossible. I, too, endured profound suffering as a result of the protracted conflict and its far-reaching repercussions. It is these personal experiences that compel me to envision a world devoid of the scourge of war. I firmly believe that competition, although a natural part of human interaction, should never escalate to the level of armed conflict. In this context, I am resolute in my rejection of warfare as a means to resolve differences.
  - question: Is blogging your primary and exclusive occupation?
    answer: No, certainly not. I am currently engaged in composing a novel that chronicles my personal experiences, with an anticipated release scheduled in six months, contingent upon the successful progression of the project. Additionally, I have a deep affinity for music, and I have been approached by a record label to undertake the production of several of my musical compositions.
  - question: What is the procedure for me to make contributions to the blog?
    answer: To contribute, it is imperative that you possess proficient written English skills and a depth of life experience on a specific subject to offer meaningful solutions. Please initiate contact by sending a message through the designated contact page, accompanied by a link to your most exemplary work.
  - question: What is the total number of posts that you have authored?
    answer: Inception of the blog occurred in October of 2017, during which I authored 300 articles over a period spanning two and a half years. Subsequently, I embarked on a one-year hiatus to immerse myself in the realm of web development. The current website is a tangible manifestation of the diligent efforts invested during this period. In the upcoming year, I intend to migrate all prior content from the former website to this newly established platform. I kindly request your patience during this transitional process.
