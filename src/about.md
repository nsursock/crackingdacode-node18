I was born in Beirut on Oct 5, 1980, the same day my two grandfathers were born. At that time, Lebanon was amidst a Civil War that would make many Lebanese flee the country, including my family. In 1983, when I was three years old, I couldn't sleep anymore because of bombardments, and my parents decided to settle in Paris, France, where I lived until now.

## The Dead Rule The Living

When I was young, I would spend my time playing on a computer or with my cousins. My father has three sisters who all have children, and we were a united family, thanks to my grandmother, who was a widow.

I had a somewhat normal childhood until 1994, when I witnessed violence to a loved one who died shortly after. Since then, I have been convinced that all humanity's problems are due to this time and place, adolescence in the 16th district of Paris.

I started reading detective novels that would inspire me to investigate and try to get confirmation on my initial gut feeling. But unfortunately, the death of my friend sent me into a deep depressive state, and I would earn my A-levels with a narrow margin.

At first, I hesitated to stay in Paris due to the bullying of some classmates/teachers and because I was the Mediterranean at heart. After all, Paris's awful oceanic degraded climate could be the reason behind the violence.

But a summer trip to Los Angeles in 1998 made me regain my confidence by studying astronomy and getting a good grade. After that, I was sure my environment in Paris was toxic. It was dangerous, and I fell.

I met my mentor, a music teacher, and coach in 1995: I had an immense love for music and started learning to play the guitar and the saxophone. I also took singing lessons because a guitarist who can sing would find work more quickly. My heroes were Jimi Hendrix, Eric Clapton, and Frank Zappa.

## An Artist At War With The World

I spent my student years at a university in the Paris region. At first, I was a bit stunned by all the boys in the school (it was an engineering school). But, after all, I spent my teenage years in an all-girls school that had recently opened to welcome boys. But I was very selective with the people I would call my friends and finally met a beautiful and intelligent law student I dated for three years.

I loved signal processing at school: I was an early adopter of the MP3 revolution, and I had spent my childhood working on the sound of my guitar on the computer, applying filters and stuff. But in my world, Paris and Beirut upper-society, if you didn't work in banks, you weren't a serious person.

My girlfriend thought the same and wanted me to work in a bank. We separated, but I decided to work in a bank after a final internship in signal processing that paid peanuts. When I started, I had a junior salary, but my generation was filled with the stress of the worldwide War on Terror.

I would spend seven years in banks working from 9 to 5, sometimes later. I wanted to succeed and not be bored. Unfortunately, I became a workaholic at that time, and my body would send me the bill years later.

Working in those banks during the War on Terror was unique: I lasted seven years, and it was so dangerous that in the end, the secret service contacted me to help me. There was no misunderstanding: rape and murder were just a shot away.

## A Life Dedicated To Music

After those seven years in banks that ended in 2011, I decided that it would be for music and signal processing if I had to make sacrifices. I was so lucky to find the courage to ditch security until the bitter end.

I was looking for a way to bring back peace in the Middle East, a beautiful region in turmoil because of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Anyone who lives near the Mediterranean sea knows how blissful it is to settle there. Except when the Nazis are around.

On this journey, I met God: his/her existence is 100% sure for me. And I was helped to discover a code that would make us light in the long run. A code hidden in music I'm trying now to crack, and I'm writing this blog for this reason: I want to end perplexity.

<!-- ```
[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Well she's walking, through the clouds
With a circus mind that's running round
Butterflies and zebras
And moonbeams
And-a, fairytales
That's all she ever thinks about
Riding with the wind


[Verse 2]
When I'm sad, she comes to me
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free
It's alright, she said, it's alright
Take anything you want from me
Anything, anything
Fly on, little wing

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, little wing
