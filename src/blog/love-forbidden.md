I already talked about love in a previous post. If both of you have the permit you can expect miracles like “chabadabada”. But is love a drug and, if it is, who can deal pure lovine giving you the right direction?

I try to get out of my home everyday: maybe I’m trying to answering the question “what’s in store?”

This is a drug and, if I don’t get some water soon, I’ll be dead and gone in the afternoon. With love you can expect a bit of fresh air and breathing. You can also expect to dig the old memories like when you tried to do some ski jumping in Paris during Spring.

With love, you get up and nothing gets you down. There’s one thing you recall: it takes two baby. It’s not like caffeine or nicotine you can use to isolate yourself and contemplate the scenery. Prioritise lovine if you want to reconnect with your past then.

## You Troll Downtown And Look Around.

Ok, I got my cigarettes and my morning coffee. Now I need a kiss and maybe more. You look around and are searching for candidates. You might look for a representative of what you really like: a perfect body and a perfect face.

But you know deep inside you’re not alone. Needless to say you start ruminating and feeling intense emotions about that old memory when you were in love. You remember the path that led you to that place. But of course the inverse of your shangri-la returned beneath the summer moon.

And then you stumble upon the perfect body and face. Immediately, the question popping in your head is very clear and exciting: what the hell is this person hiding? In communication, they like to remind us that what you don’t say is more important than what you say.

## Dim The Lights If You Want To Shine.

It’s an every day reminder of our place in the universe: if you want to shine like a star and be noticed, you have to be the darkest possible. On my blog, I was surprised to notice PG-rated content (sexual, violence, swearing). By the way, PG stands for parental guidance.

In photography it seems the basis is to play with the light. But I’m a musician and the only thing I can do is play with the fundamentals for wonderful harmonics.

It’s true vision is an important sense that takes a lot of processing power in the brain. But hearing is much more relevant and conveys much more information. I’m still having troubles finding my voice on this blog. Don’t be shocked but I still wonder what’s my favorite alcoholic beverage: tequila sunrise, spritz aperol, or vodka/apple/orange.

Every day I drink beers (Almaza mainly even though sometimes it’s 961, pure lebanese beer). My voice is very clear: it should have integrity and clarity.

## Is There A Superior Drug For Everybody?

Love is a drug and we need to score. It’s distant and obscure but it remains the cure. Only if it allows you to stay on the road and get you to your destination.

I had some bad trips a few times in my life. Not much compared to other people I guess but I’ve been dizzy for 4 years now. The last time I fell in love, I almost ended up ruined and alone. My partner was whispering in my ear and we lost a few people.

Today I’m writing in a state of total confusion: an undercover agent is still toying with me. I’m the last shadow puppet because it’s subtle as a volcano: it’s going to blow. Except maybe if you live next to a volcano.

## There Are 3 Types Of Volcanoes.

There are three ways to describe a volcano’s activity; there can be active, dormant, or extinct volcanoes. Active volcanoes have erupted recently. A dormant volcano isn’t erupting right now, but vulcanologists expect it could erupt at any time. Extinct volcanoes haven’t erupted for tens of thousands of years, and aren’t expected to erupt again.

What causes volcanoes to go extinct? Simply put, they’re cut off from their supply of lava. This is where a chamber of magma underneath the surface of the Earth finds its way to the surface through weaknesses in the crust. A good example of this is the hotspot that created the chain of Hawaiian Islands.

If we compare human beings to volcanoes, you can go extinct only if your legitimate expectations fade away and you move on from that night in Tunisia. Yes the night belongs to lover and 10,000 bipolar and schizophrenic people will agree.

```
[Intro]
T'ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

[Verse 1]
Aggravated
I spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place
I jump up, bubble up
What's in store?
Love is the drug
And I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on


[Pre-Chorus]
Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Late that night
I parked my car
Staked my place
In the singles bar
Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble round
I say "go," she say "yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug
Got a hook in me

[Chorus]
Oh, get that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, oh, ohh
Ohh, oh, ohh, oh
Love is, love is
Love is the drug
```
