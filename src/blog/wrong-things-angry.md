title2: Does It Make You Unsure Too?
description: Now Beirut can compete with Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 200 dead, 6k wounded and 300k homeless. Life goes on though but I doubt we can carry on that way.

When Lebanon is bleeding, France also suffers with the country. Those words from Francois Hollande, a former French socialist president, sums it all. And, of course, I found a song that reminds us this isn't surprising.

A massive explosion took place in the seaport of Beirut yesterday. We had the honor to have a mushroom for hallucinating all week long about the incident.

We don't know everything about it yet because some people swear seeing airplanes before the fire, and the explosion happened. Of course, the neighbors are suspicious.

What we do know is that there is no window spared in Beirut since the explosion. I still didn't get out of my suburb, but I need to go to Beirut today. I'm a little afraid of what we will find. Scenes that remind us of the Civil War are a bit too emotional for many people.

When things go wrong, go wrong with you, it hurts me too â€” except maybe if one man's loss is another man's gain.

## Did It Make You Almost Lose Your Mind?

It seems the brain is in charge of accounting. No wonder you're hurting right now with that kind of explosion sending Beirut back 35 years in the past. Who wants to relive the Civil War?

I was in the middle of a meeting when the explosion happened. At first, we thought it was an earthquake. Some say it was like an earthquake of 4.5 magnitudes. But there would be no whisper during an earthquake.

Here we have a massive explosion of stuff that was confiscated a few years ago. One can wonder why dangerous chemicals are stored near a big city like Beirut. What happens in case there's a problem?

This incident or accident makes no sense at all. And we should seriously consider the possibility of a terrorist attack.

## If They Hurt Us All The Time Is This Love From The Neighbours?

It makes no sense at all, and the possibility of planes flying before the incident should be examined as soon as possible. You can't leave a reasonable doubt around the circumstances of such a massive explosion.

We know Netanyahu is disputed in his country, our neighbor Israel. They say he's a strong leader, but the reason might be simple: he's bringing everybody down like someone depressive.

I mean you have the right sometimes to be tired. But please, in that case, stay home and don't run a country. When the reign of Netanyahu is over, I hope we can envision the future without mass destruction.

But we should also watch out for Syria and Putin, who wants to stay king the longer possible. A bit like Netanyahu since 2009.

## Do You Feel Like Sticking Like Glue To The Incident?

Now all I can think of is this explosion. Lebanon declared three days of national mourning. I'm trying to think about something else by watching a movie or a basketball game. But this is reality guys: 70 dead and 3000 wounded.

I spend all day in Ashrafieh most of the time. Yesterday I was home in Hazmieh early for a Skype meeting that stopped suddenly when the explosion took place.

Sometimes I can't help but wonder what would have happened to me if I was in Beirut at that moment (which would have been likely). I'm already dealing with a lot of pain daily since 2001. Depression was so much better in the 1990s.

Since 2001, we witnessed the terrorist attacks in New York, the 2006 war between Israel and Lebanon, and the discovery of Bin Laden in 2011. Of course, you shouldn't forget to smile while dealing with the pain.

I'm so afraid the 2000s - 2010s could be a lost decade. And you stick to the bad moments like glue.

## Deep Down Are You Still Confused About Yesterday?

All in all, I'm still confused about yesterday and the past 20 years. That's because depression was much better in the 1990s: We had Nirvana and the grunge movement. But I guess we can't go wrong playing a blues song.

Yesterday's gone, but the memory still lingers on. We need to know now if it was a terrorist attack or a stupid accident. It looked like a terrorist attack with the spectacular mushroom that still gives people hallucinations.

I dream of a future without weapons of mass destruction. I know I'm not the only one to dream big. Our children can't handle the load anymore. And they will ask one day why they only have one eye.

```
[Verse 1]
The more of you that I inspect
The more of me I see reflect
The more I try to read your lips
The more the mask you're wearing rips
But when I seek out your voice
My ears are overcome with noise
You show and tell with greatest ease
Raving impossibilities

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry


[Verse 2]
And when the story takes a twist
It folds like a contortionist
Slight of hand and quick exchange
The old tricks have been rearranged

[Chorus]
Engaged in crime I grasp my throat
Enraged my mind starts to smoke
Enforce a mental overload
Angry again, angry again, angry

[Bridge]
The searing of the sinew
My body fights for air
The ripping of the tissue
My lungs begin to tear
Gravity's got my bones
It pulls my flesh away
The steam finally dissipates
I make out my sweaty face

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Association that I choose
Game I inevitably lose
Governed by laws set up by me
Fracture its jaw to let me be
A cut-out cardboard condo maze
Filled with an insubordinate race
Irrational youths stop to stare
As music rubber hosed the air
```
