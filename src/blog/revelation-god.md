Much has been said about God if he/she exists. We even had several prophets to give humanity the words of God. To me, it seems quite clear that history is repeating even though the newspaper doesn’t shout about it.

Why am I talking about the point of view of God? Today I was driving my car and remembered how sometimes when I was young, listening to the radio made a lasting impression on me. They liked to play “Eye in the Sky” by Alan Parsons Project. Lately, I was listening to the song, and my mother came and said: “I like this song.”

Thanks to my French and English culture, I’m able to find meaning in the title of the song. If you mix both cultures, then the title could mean “it’s a real pain watching you.”

Let’s talk about the point of view of God on humanity and the Earth. But first, let’s remember the original sin that Christianity talked about.

## An Apple A Day Will Make You Dangerous.

Original sin, also called ancestral sin, is a Christian belief in the state of sin in which humanity has existed since the fall of man, stemming from Adam and Eve’s rebellion in Eden, namely the sin of disobedience in consuming the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

It’s good to note that only Jesus talked about original sin; no other religions have ever talked about it. Maybe music mentioned it with INXS’ song “Original Sin”; they were talking about playing with fire.

The concept of original sin was first alluded to in the 2nd century by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon, in his controversy with certain dualist Gnostics. Other church fathers such as Augustine also shaped and developed the doctrine.

The toxic artwork of taking a sip from the devil’s cup should be explained. The original sin was about knowledge, and let’s see if this is a problem.

## Should You Avoid Trucks Clearly Coming For You?

Let’s take a simple example to illustrate my meaning. They told us there was a forbidden fruit that will give us conscience and knowledge. It’s as if someone gave me a pill to notice cars and trucks surrounding me while I’m driving. Please rest assured this is critical, and this is no sin to be aware of its surroundings.

That might be a big problem with Christianity. The original sin doesn’t seem like a real problem since knowledge and perception is critical. But I have a point of view on the original sin that’s making God intrigued, maybe mad but patient.

Time doesn’t mend those who suffered from a crime against humanity. What’s crime exactly but a mishap or a failure? It seems criminology is the study of behavior.

Wanting to have a better perception of your environment is no sin at all. And now, let’s explain what’s my point of view on God’s trouble.

## Open Your Mouth And Try To Be Brutally Honest.

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

According to me, the original sin, if there was one, is apparent: there was a lack of honesty and truthfulness. Some people died, and we continued our route as if nothing happened.

One day someone accountable might show up. He or she will explain that, even though our last effort was impressive, it doesn’t compare to other universes full of altruism and exercise. On Earth, we proved that perfect fidelity could be achieved if you avoid parties full of students.

There’s something magical happening when your age is between 18 and 23. You feel kind of free and empowered. The brutal truth is that, when you reach age 25, you realize you again spent 5 years in prison. Of course, nobody knows the crime except a mishap or a failure or behavior still perfectible.

The original sin, if the concept is interesting, might have been about honesty in your intentions. But did you know heartaches don’t last forever?

## Finish Your Life With Approximations Like A Mad Man.

The fact that other religions don’t talk about an original sin should make Christians a little nervous. After all, when I was 14, a guy in my class suggested that Jesus was a collective hallucination. Christianity had some real bad press for several decades thanks to scandals with children.

Jesus’ message shouldn’t make us forget that the Christian Byzantine empire left us a wonderful heritage. So what can be the problem exactly? In 1789, they said we worship a Supreme Being, and we like reason. Dire Straits will say that “when you find the reason, you can’t get used to it.”

I don’t know if there was an original sin, but what I know for sure is that God is confused by a strange scene he/she witnesses every day. Someone is publicly raped, and the only way out is the mouth and words.

```
[Verse 1]
You might know of the original sin
And you might know how to play with fire
But did you know of the murder committed
In the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity

[Chorus]
Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

[Verse 2]
There was a time when I did not care
And there was a time when the facts did stare
There is a dream and it's held by many
Well I'm sure you had to see
It's open arms

[Chorus]
Dream on white boy
Dream on black girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

Dream on black boy
Dream on white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams have washed away

Dream on black boy
Dream on white girl
And wake up to a brand new day
To find your dreams are washed away

Dream on, play with fire
White boy, black girl
Dream on, in the name of love
Black boy, white girl

Dream on, white boy, black girl
Black boy, white girl

Dream on, the name of love - yeah
You thought what a pity

Original Sin
```
