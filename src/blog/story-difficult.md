Today, I wish to embark on a new approach. Naturally, I have a narrative to share, and I contemplate whether someone will generously contribute to it. It might be said that the rewards I reap do not align with my efforts.

Nonetheless, the intricacies of this narrative are not readily apparent, for they do not trace their origins to the family lineage.

For inexplicable reasons, an unusual turn of events occurred on the path to reaching lofty heights. From my perspective, I may have neglected an essential task – the expression of gratitude. But one might question the appropriateness of such gratitude when it was these very people who bestowed upon me the affliction of cancer.

Yes, I am referring to the formidable adversaries of the educational realm. They bestowed upon me the burden of cancer, and it feels akin to a performance or a musical ensemble: I must persist until the perfect tune finds me.

Today, the composition I have chosen is titled "Family Tree" by Sharon Brown, featured in DJ Spinna's "Strange Games and Funky Things, Vol. 5." The artwork appears to depict individuals pondering the events unfolding before them, perhaps in an Afghan context.

## Precisely Where Was I Destined to Be Born?

I came into this world in Beirut in the year 1980, more specifically on the 5th of October. A few months prior, my grandfather had passed away, and I bear the same name as he did. In Lebanon, it is customary to bestow upon one's offspring the same first name as their paternal forebears.

My prenatal circumstances seem to have been somewhat unconventional. It appears that I entered the world during a period that is colloquially referred to as the Golden Age of the Adult Entertainment industry. This era marked a significant milestone, suggesting that, after many years of striving, this industry had finally gained widespread recognition. Men, it seemed, were exhibiting their anatomy with a newfound boldness.

It is apparent that two millennia of history are not easily erased. My lineage hails from the Byzantine tradition, and our family settled in Beirut towards the close of the 18th century. The scope of our heritage is vast, and the Byzantine Empire's longevity, extending a millennium, bears testament to its magnificence.

Today, I find myself deeply indebted to a piece of invaluable advice, contemplating whether I should leverage my heritage.

## How Can One Gauge the Economic Well-being?

If one were to gauge the economic health of our times based on acts of generosity, a peculiar era would indeed be revealed. The period between 2007 and 2012 remains etched in collective memory as a dire recession, unparalleled since the catastrophic events of 1929.

I was present in a financial institution during that tumultuous period and witnessed the fall of Lehman Brothers. This financial institution had been akin to a tranquil, translucent pond, but an unseen force had managed to cast a colossal stone, creating ripples of unease.

In my near two-year journey as a blogger, I have been the recipient of three donations. This scant record suggests that the state of the economy is precarious, and it appears that we must patiently await the year 2020 to discern a significant shift. I am not content with meandering aimlessly; my goal is to attain a daily readership of 1000.

At times, I take pride in my blogging endeavors, while at other times, I am adrift, akin to a child without a mother, uncertain of where my true home resides.

## Can You Select Among These Five Refuges?

Let us partake in a game termed "A Song – A Shelter." In this whimsical exercise, your residential address is represented by a song title, or perhaps an entire album. The game revolves around albums instead of individual songs, with each selection accompanied by an elucidation of its what, when, why, and how:
 - My abode is reminiscent of "Achtung Baby" by U2, symbolizing an awareness that life is a game, and dire circumstances compel us to reconsider the rules while fostering a spirit of solidarity.
 - My dwelling evokes the spirit of "Are You Experienced?" by Jimi Hendrix, highlighting the paramount importance of experience in shaping the gravity or levity of life.
 - My residence mirrors the essence of "From The Cradle" by Eric Clapton, acknowledging that life invariably introduces the blues as soon as one is born, and that these blues should be sung.
 - My habitat resonates with the aura of "Zooropa" by U2, acknowledging that European civilization, while intriguing, remains a jungle where one might find themselves ensnared by a joker.
 - My homestead aligns with the essence of "Strange Games & Funky Things Vol. 5," recognizing that certain games are best left unplayed, and emotions can at times be profoundly intense.

## Do You Experience a Desire to Change Residences on a Daily Basis?

In the past, I resided independently in Paris. Naturally, before that, I lived with my parents, and presently, I have returned to their care while awaiting a blog post that could yield a daily income of $2000. However, there exists within me an intensity that prompts me to seek new shelters daily.

Today, my refuge is found in the music of Sharon Brown and the album by DJ Spinna.

It is imperative to acknowledge that music can serve as a sanctuary at any time and in any place. Music is a more economical alternative to a psychiatrist, but it necessitates empathy. While one might consider other substances, such as MDMA, their legality remains a concern, and their medical applications remain unapproved as of 2018. The desired effects encompass altered sensations, heightened energy, enhanced empathy, and increased pleasure.

Such substances could provide insulation against individuals who perpetuate the rigors of peculiar games and inject funkiness into our lives. Although I hold a fondness for funk music, I have wearied of ceaseless perspiration.

Now, you understand the challenges that render my narrative arduous to convey. I once practiced medicine, and I now grapple with compassion fatigue.

P.S.: I have ultimately selected a different song from the album for illustrative purposes. I invite you to explore it – it is a composition by the Rolling Stones, featuring vocals by Merry Clayton!

Ooh, that storm is threatenin' my very life today
If I don't get me no shelter
