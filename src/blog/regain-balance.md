Limp Bizkit already sang about it in 2000 in their hit song “Take a Look Around.” They were singing about secrets or a combination. They were also wondering where this Grail was.

Yesterday I was blogging about stories and how sometimes they’re not easy to see.

Now I’m glad I found the secret or the combination, and only a happy few will believe in this code. But I can’t help but wonder if it doesn’t make me a creep.

Information is critical, and ignoring information is like ignoring a truck that is driving your way at 100 miles an hour. The heart knows the difference. And remember the definition of the heart I came up with:
 1. compensation, because you can’t always win even though it should be the goal,
 2. precision, because otherwise, I won’t make the difference between tea and coffee.

I guess when you are weak, you should stay at home. Or maybe do something to embrace the future. It can’t be that dark and full of remorse (disgust and sadness).

## What’s The First Thing You Do In The Morning?

ZZ Top used to sing that the first thing they did in the morning was wearing cheap sunglasses. As if the sun was shining too much. Maybe they just meant they have a problem with the distance of the people around them. What if they had a fan that was insulting them because it’s hard to face the facts?

Well, I’m broke, but I don’t care. Because it’s not the first time, and I always managed to get back on track.

Cheap sunglasses means the light is disturbing you. Every day I’m in a coffee shop or restaurant: I don’t know why they keep the lights on during the day. I already talked with them about it.

Sometimes you can have strange attitudes or irrational thoughts. But if you’re at the right distance where life can thrive, then it shouldn’t be a problem.

## What If Justice Was Just Real Slow?

You know what they say about justice: it’s very slow because most cases are complex. Or maybe they remembered the lesson from “12 Angry Men”. For those who don’t know the movie, here is a quick description.

12 Angry Men is a 1957 American courtroom drama film directed by Sidney Lumet, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. This courtroom drama tells the story of a jury of 12 men as they deliberate the conviction or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt, forcing the jurors to question their morals and values. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous.

12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building and the difficulties encountered in the process among this group of men whose range of personalities adds to the intensity and conflict. It also explores the power one person has to elicit change.

A disgusting mix of intimidation and cowardice can mess you up like your sibling’s room. But justice will always be about purest hell and holy cows (rumination and intensity).

## Are They Trying To Make An Angel Out Of You?

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">
  <img x-intersect.once.ratio-0="$el.src = $el.dataset.src" class="rounded-lg" alt="woman wearing white angel wings" data-src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494631781929-c23495644b46?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800&h=600">

I know what you think: this is black magic and only New Orleans’ voodoo could explain why you feel like stone. Some friends are vanished and gone. It’s about rumination but one should ask the following question.

Do I want to be an angel or a devil? What are the pros and cons?

If you want to be a devil, make sure to check your bones regularly. It seems you can only rely on your sister (maybe 1st-degree cousins) in case there’s a problem. If you want to be an angel, people will wonder at some point if you’re protecting them.

As in all things, it might be a general adaptation syndrome. Oscar Wilde said he “didn’t want to go to heaven because none of his friends were there.” But, truth be told, being a devil might be a luxury you can’t afford if you care about society.

Again being able to have a healthy mix might also be a solution to your legs feeling like a stone. When are we going to go on holiday?

## Should You Write Or Talk About It?

<aside class="md:-ml-56 md:float-left w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

In summary, to regain your balance and stop feeling like stone, the solution is easy to see: you have to tell your story, but remember to make it short. Normal people don’t have time to read. What I mean is that the people you want in your life are busy; otherwise, lazy and selfish people will bring you down.

Give the bottom line and stay as superficial as you can. And make sure you don’t have ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder).

If you do, you might again have trouble with an Oedipus complex. Freud thought it was the main problem with humanity. Or maybe the main problem is simply invaders that are far away now.

And remember this line from a song by Gil-Scott Heron: you got 10 years to lose if they catch you or if you catch them. I guess he was talking about invaders that are now far away! Sorry, Dr. Freud!

[Verse 1]
Everyday in the week, I'm in a different city
If I stay too long, the people try to pull me down
They talk about me like a dog, talk about the clothes I wear
But they don't realize they're the ones who's square

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why you can't hold me down
I don't want to be down
I got to move on
Aw!

[Chorus]
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away right now
Yeah, alright

[Verse 2]
Listen to this baby
A woman here, a woman there, try to keep me in a plastic cage
But they don't realize it's so easy to break
Oh but sometimes I can, ha
I can feel my heart kind of running hot
That's when I got to move, before I get caught

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey, and that's why, listen to me baby, you can't hold me down
I don't want to be tied down
I got to be free
Aw!

[Chorus]
I said
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to get away
Yeah, aw
Turn me loose baby

[Guitar solo]
Yeah, aw!
Uh huh, yeah!

[Chorus]
I said
Stone free, to ride the breeze
Stone free, to do what I please
Stone free, I can't stay
I got to, got to, got to, got to get away

[Outro]
Stone free
I'm gonna leave right now
Stone free
Don't turn on me back
Stone free
I'm going on down the highway, yeah
Stone free
Got to, got to, got to, got to, got to
Stone free
Ooh hell, bye bye baby
Stone free
Aw
```
