There are thieves in the temple. The word is out and everyone is panicking. They don't care where they kick just as long as they hurt you. This is insane: all you did was say hello.

Pain is a distressing feeling often caused by intense or damaging stimuli. In medical diagnosis, pain is regarded as a symptom of an underlying condition.

Pain motivates the individual to withdraw from damaging situations, to protect a damaged body part while it heals, and to avoid similar experiences in the future. Most pain resolves once the noxious stimulus is removed and the body has healed, but it may persist despite the removal of the stimulus and apparent healing of the body. Sometimes pain arises in the absence of any detectable stimulus, damage, or disease.

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultation in most developed countries. It is a major symptom in many medical conditions and can interfere with a person's quality of life and general functioning. Psychological factors such as social support, hypnotic suggestion, cognitive behavioral therapy, excitement, or distraction can affect pain's intensity or unpleasantness.

## Distant And Obscure Love Remains The Cure?

According to some artists, love remains the cure to heal from bruises and wounds. That's because love is an intense pleasant experience. I've loved once and never thought about if it healed my wounds. But it was a very nice and tolerant experience.

Maybe pain says hello when you reach a point when you can't be tolerant anymore. After all, pain and pleasure are part of life. And I like to think that pain says a lot about pleasure.

Tolerance is the capacity to endure continued subjection to something such as a drug or environmental conditions without adverse reaction. It's also the diminution in the body's response to a drug after continued use.

The problem is that one day you will find life intolerable. Cruelty is everywhere and we know the cure: love.

## Is This Love That You're Feeling?

Love encompasses a range of strong and positive emotional and mental states, from the most sublime virtue or good habit, the deepest interpersonal affection, and to the simplest pleasure. An example of this range of meanings is that the love of a mother differs from the love of a spouse, which differs from the love of food. Most commonly, love refers to a feeling of strong attraction and emotional attachment.

If it's love that you got, then you got a lot. You shouldn't give up on love easily. That's what happened to me and my love story lasted 3 years even though a bad nightmare managed to bring me down.

## Love's The Cure But How Many Kinds Are There?

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

The diversity of uses and meanings combined with the complexity of the feelings involved makes love unusually difficult to consistently define, compared to other emotional states.

Ancient Greek philosophers identified five forms of love: essentially, familial love (in Greek, Storge), friendly love or platonic love (Philia), romantic love (Eros), guest love (Xenia), and divine love (Agape). Modern authors have distinguished further varieties of love: unrequited love, empty love, companionate love, consummate love, infatuated love, self-love, and courtly love.

Love to me is like friendship with a few differences: I'm talking about sexual activity that you make with your romantic partner. And we all know making love is so good for your health.

Since I started this blog, I can't make love anymore. That's because every day I try to talk about something interesting and it's exhausting. Don't be surprised if this blog stops or if the rate of posting becomes once a month.

## What If Friendship Was Also A Good Cure?

<aside class="md:-ml-56 md:float-left w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

Overall, the cure might also be a friend. Someone that will be there in good times and bad times. Someone who will be on your side.

Of course, making love is important and that's a strong case for love to be the cure. That's because when you make love, there's a bombardment of neurotransmitters in your brain. Your body becomes one filled with coherence and life.

If friendship is the cure, I must say music is my choice. I once had an incredible experience with music. I was in my room listening to a song and suddenly I fell on the bed crying. My whole body felt coherent as if I was making love.

I guess there must be several things to save you from this cold despair. Love remains the cure, voices from the sky suggest friendship but what if God was the cure?

The surest and quickest path to God is of course music. Anyway, watch out for the thieves in the temple: they just want to hurt you.

```
[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 1]
They don't care where they kick
Just as long as they hurt you
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
Love, if you're there, come save me
From all this cold despair
I can hang when you're around
But I'll surely die if you're not there

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 2]
I feel like they're looking for my soul (Soul)
Like a poor man looking for gold (Gold)
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
Voices from the sky say, "Rely
On your best friend to pull you through"
But even if I wanted to, I couldn't really, truly
'Cause my only friend is you
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, come on

[Chorus]
There are thieves in the temple, tonight

[Verse 3]
Kicking me in my heart
Tearing me all apart (Tearing me, tearing me)
(Tearing me, tearing me all apart)
'Cause me and you could have been
A work of art (Thieves in the temple)

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you know I'm holding on
The best that I can
Love, please help me be
The better man
Better than the thieves
(Thieves in the temple)
In the temple, tonight
Oh, thieves in the temple
(Tonight) Tonight, hurt me

[Chorus]
Love, come quick
Love, come in a hurry
There are thieves in the temple, tonight
(Thieves in the temple)

[Outro]
You said you loved me (Thieves in the temple)
You said I was your friend (Thieves in the temple)
You were supposed to take care of me
Love come quick (Thieves in the temple)
You lie! Lie! Lie! (Love, come in a hurry)
(Thieves in the temple, tonight)
```
