Perfection undeniably eludes our world. While debatable, history demonstrates that humanity's essence lies in sustenance, procreation, and evolution. The question arises: Can we ever attain the lofty aspirations of our envisioned utopia?

Moreover, it is imperative to fathom the level of consciousness that underlies the challenges we face on Earth. Religion has often conveyed the idea of redemption, implying that guilt has contributed to our current state of affairs.

Have you observed that many struggle to assimilate life's complexities? Could this position the liver as the most pivotal organ among the vital ones, such as the heart, liver, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, and brain?

An illuminating insight emerges: a pervasive undercurrent of resentment within us, signifying a broader issue related to respect. What historical tribulations have culminated in many finding themselves in retirement facilities? Dimming the lights may provide a pathway to speculation.

## Have You Acted Inadvertently Negligent Towards a Sensitive Individual?

We all have acquaintances who require additional attention and may seek a prominent place in our lives. Often, such requests stem from romantic interests, but certain individuals carry more significance than others.

In essence, these individuals are akin to infants, necessitating heightened care and perpetual vigilance. Bestowing importance upon someone comes with the inherent responsibility of oversight. What if their actions contradict the values they hold dear?

It's important to note that this pertains not to material wealth but to the quality of relationships and the positive impact that can be achieved through maintaining a harmonious equilibrium. Some individuals exhibit a mindset akin to tax collectors, adopting the stance of '10 for you, 90 for me.'

Consider the counsel of the princess: if she suggests that your attire is overly alluring, does it imply a lack of discernment in your fashion choices? Alternatively, should she reconsider her tastes, perhaps influenced by the Victorian era?

## Have You Bored Your Friends with Safe Decisions?

Existence necessitates embracing risks. At the age of 25, concerns surrounding the Middle East's geopolitical instability post-9/11 and the potential consequences of a career in banking weighed on my mind. Despite these apprehensions, I resolved to move forward, with the fallback option of returning to the more carefree days of my academic life.

The years that ensued after 2005 proved to be arduous. The backdrop was marred by terrorist attacks, political assassinations, preemptive conflicts, and the relentless pressures of achievement, making it a period difficult to endure.

However, the turning point came in 2010, ushering in significant rewards. I received a hero's welcome in my community, with even the President visiting my home. Support transcended political divides, fostering unity between the left and right.

Signs of divine presence seemed to intermingle with the natural world. On one occasion, while listening to Jimi Hendrix's 'I Don't Live Today,' a fortuitous ray of light brightened my day as the lyrics 'No Sun Coming Through My Window' played. Was this a mere coincidence?

## Have You Employed the Silent Treatment with Your Beloved?

Conflict, to me, resembles a summer's dayâ€”silent, owing to the multitude of unspoken thoughts. Alternatively, it might amuse me as I select my battles. Regardless, conflict pervades various aspects of existence, potentially even within one's psyche.

Presently, an internal struggle rages within, as I grapple with the decision to rest and contemplate or to engage in a fight-or-flight response. On one hand, dissatisfaction with my life fuels my restlessness, with anger providing an unsettling surge of energy that hinders rest. On the other hand, I've invested considerable effort in recent years to liberate myself from self-imposed constraints.

The role of a private investigator demands constant exposure to high-pressure situations, which may ultimately erode one's tolerance for physical activity.

An intriguing observation arises: while dancing unclothed before my pets, I find myself breathless a mere five seconds later.

## Guessed It All or Should I Clarify Further?

In conclusion, if one cannot deduce meaning from people's statements, it presents a challenge I find difficult to address. Clarity of thought and the ability to grasp life's implications are distinct qualities.

For instance, following the 2015 terror attacks, when authorities warned me that I was 'not far from the electric chair,' I recognized their appetite for information regarding the perpetrators of that tragedy.

Another case involved someone suggesting I was akin to Jesus at the age of 30, implying a limited time remaining. I've exceeded that timeline, though the journey remains challenging. Confusion is a constant companion. Attempt to infer the rest; it may lead to a smoother life.

[Intro]
T'ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

[Verse 1]
Aggravated
I spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place
I jump up, bubble up
What's in store?
Love is the drug
And I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on

[Pre-Chorus]
Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Late that night
I parked my car
Staked my place
In the singles bar
Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble round
I say "go," she say "yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug
Got a hook in me

[Chorus]
Oh, get that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, oh, ohh
Ohh, oh, ohh, oh
Love is, love is
Love is the drug
```
