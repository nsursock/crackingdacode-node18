title: Should You Dim The Lights 
title2: If You Have A Radiant Illumination?
description: Those "Eureka!" moments are pretty rare and it's a shame something could tarnish their memory. Dim the lights and it will fade imperfections away.

There's no doubt perfection doesn't exist in this world. Of course, this is debatable, but history teaches us that humanity is about eating, reproducing, and evolving. Will we ever reach the dizzy heights of that dreamed-of world?

Anyway, we must identify the level of consciousness that created all the problems down here on Earth. I think it's pretty clear religion explained to us that we are here to redeem ourselves. So guilt engineered our current state of affairs.

Have you noticed that most of us have trouble digesting things during our lives? Does this make the liver the most vital organ of the indispensable organs (heart, liver, pancreas, lungs, kidneys, and brain) instead of the heart?

The illumination I had is that we're all immensely resentful. Which means we have a problem with respect. What's so troubling in our past that we all finish in a retirement facility? Dim the lights, and let's try to guess.

## Have You Been Unfortunately Careless With Someone Delicate?

We all have that friend who needs extra attention. They need to be put on a pedestal. Most of the time, this is a request from your crush, but some people are more important than others.

Technically, those people are assimilated as babies. They need extra care, and they always have to be monitored. You can't let someone be important without surveillance! What if that person does something against the values they revere?

It's not about silver or gold. It's about love and how positive you can get by having a balanced relationship with people. Some people are like taxmen: "There's 10 for you, 90 for me."

Trust the princess: if she says you're too sexy for your hat, does that mean you have no taste in clothing? Or should she forget about her awful taste dating from the Victorian era?

## Did You Make Your Friends Bored With A Safe Bet?

Being alive is taking risks. When I was 25, I was worried about the geopolitical situation in the Middle East following 9/11, and what would happen if I worked in banking. I decided to go for it, and, if anything went wrong, revert to a student lifestyle, when I was blooming.

What happened after 2005 was awful, and I'm still reeling from that period. The atmosphere created by terrorist attacks, political assassinations, preventive wars, and the stress of succeeding was too much to handle.

Yet in 2010, everything unfolded, and the rewards were great. I was greeted as a local hero in my neighborhood. The president made the trip to my house, and the left and the right decided to support me for the next 5 years.

Even God manifested himself with Nature showing clear signs of communion. For example, one day I was listening to Jimi Hendrix's song I Don't Live Today. When the sentence "No Sun Coming Through My Window" played, a ray of light appeared to brighten my day. Coincidence?

## Did You Give The Silent Treatment To Your Loved Ones?

Conflict to me is like a summer day: silent because there's too much to say. Or maybe it makes me amused to choose my battles. In any case, conflict is everywhere, even maybe in your psyche.

At the moment, there's a war raging inside me because I'm trying to decide if I should rest and digest or fight or flight. On the one hand, I'm not satisfied with my life, and the anger gives me energy making it hard to rest. On the other hand, I worked so hard during the past years to free myself from those chains.

What does it imply to be a private investigator? Most of the time, you're in high-pressure situations, and it can make you intolerant to exercise in the long run.

When I dance naked in front of my pets, 5 seconds later I'm breathless.

## Did You Guess The Rest Or Should I Be Fucking Explicit?

All in all, if you can't make assumptions from what people tell you, then I don't know how I can help you. It's one thing to be lucid and have a clear mind; it's another thing not to get the implications of life.

For example, when the state told me that "I wasn't far from the electric chair" after the 2015 terror attacks, I knew they would crave information. Who was responsible for this bloodbath?

Another example is when someone told me I was Jesus when I was 30 years old. I knew this would imply I would only have 3 years to live.

I'm still here, but it isn't easy. Confusion is nothing new. Try to guess the rest, you will render life smoother.

[Intro]
T'ain't no big thing
To wait for the bell to ring
T'ain't no big thing
The toll of the bell

[Verse 1]
Aggravated
I spare for days
I troll downtown
The red light place
I jump up, bubble up
What's in store?
Love is the drug
And I need to score
Showing out, showing out, hit and run
Boy meets girl
Where the beat goes on

[Pre-Chorus]
Stitched up tight
Can't shake free
Love is the drug
Got a hook on me

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Late that night
I parked my car
Staked my place
In the singles bar
Face to face
Toe to toe
Heart to heart
As we hit the floor

[Pre-Chorus]
Lumbered up, limbo down
The locked embrace
The stumble round
I say "go," she say "yes"
Dim the lights, you can guess the rest

[Chorus]
Oh, catch that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug
Got a hook in me

[Chorus]
Oh, get that buzz
Love is the drug
I'm thinking of
Oh, can't you see
Love is the drug for me

[Outro]
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh
Ohh, ohh, oh
Ohh, oh, ohh
Ohh, oh, ohh, oh
Love is, love is
Love is the drug
```
