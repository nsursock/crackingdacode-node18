We all want to be healthy, make great things, help humanity advance, and hope we will be remembered with love. But when someone doesn’t feel well, the doctor needs to take into account his or her singularity. They broke another mirror and are turning into Frankenstein.

A singularity is defined this way: it’s when the laws of physics don’t apply anymore. To be more precise, a singularity or uniqueness is a location in spacetime where the gravitational field of a celestial body is predicted to become infinite by general relativity in a way that does not depend on the coordinate system. The quantities used to measure gravitational field strength are the scalar invariant curvatures of spacetime, which includes a measure of the density of matter.

Since such quantities become infinite at the singularity, the laws of normal spacetime break down. There you have it: infinity is not a 4 letter word, and we have to find a way to measure love. Let’s use time as the primary tool.

## Did You Give 27 Years Of Your Life For Paris?

In 1994, when I was 14 years old, I decided the district where I lived was worthy of investigation. Yes, I’m talking about the 16th district of Paris known for concentrating people who have a lot of money.

They told me I had 10 years to lose if they catch me. And it seems real. Why did I start an investigation on this district? The answer is simple: someone died at age 14.

Since that moment, I was listening to a lot to music and found some answers. We had the dreamer’s disease. And we were down on our knees. But some of us have music in us.

## Did You Work 5 Interminable Years For Someone?

Have you ever been mistreated? You know I’m talking about. Someone owes me money, and 10 years later, I’m still waiting for the payment.

The best things in life are the simple things: like a walk down on Main Street or giving the best years of your life to a company that is known for treating its employees like shit. Yes, my former company was clear about its human resource department, and I should have been more cautious.

I worked for 5 years for a company whose name in French means: “love you badly.” Of course, the company’s message was clear: what do you expect? Well, I was on a mission to the new frontier: I want to give humanity hope and get us out of Earth and even the Milky Way.

We are under the same sun, and it’s been 7 million years now. How’s that for a love story?

## Did Your Small Business Take Off After 2 Years?

If there’s one piece of advice for every small business on Earth, it’s this one: if you don’t allow yourself a little time before deciding your business can succeed, you will never reach the high. After 2 years, you start noticing little sparks in your statistics like donations and so on and so forth.

Everything is risky, but it seems investors will try to understand the basics of your business before putting some money. As a business, you should aim for a 5:1 profit margin.

I guess the risk isn’t visible to the naked eye: you have to observe it in the infrared, which means that if your business can warm a little this cold world, it can succeed. Yes, you have to monitor your risk with a particular eye.

## Did You Spend 39 Years On The Inside Out?

On the whole, I know some friends who decided to leave the planet because of Paris and the big dicks in the neighborhood. Today, I also want to leave Paris to enjoy the light from Lebanon. The reason is simple: with the right view, I might discover everything I need is in the room.

I was born in Beirut in 1980 and headed to Paris in 1983. But in Paris, I can’t find what I’m looking for: understanding and peace of mind. If it’s not asking too much, please send me some money and someone to love. Which means I need somebody to walk with.

Yes, I do think that love can be measured with time. Because time is also money, it could also be a climate. For example, who was that Egyptian killer that rang on my door when I was 14 years old? Was it someone who wanted to protect the girls around me? Did that Egyptian think that I also wanted to protect someone?

So many questions remain unanswered, and the answers we found create new issues. I guess our universe might be eternal or infinite then. I’m not sure about that one, but the numbers are significant.

```
[Verse 1]
Where do I begin?
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love he brings to me
Where do I start?

[Verse 2]
Like a summer rain
That cools the pavement with a patent leather shine
He came into my life and made the living fine
And gave a meaning to this empty world of mine
He fills my heart

[Chorus]
He fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
He fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

[Verse 3]
How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I'm going to need him till the stars all burn away
And he'll be there

[Chorus]
He fills my heart with very special things
With angels' songs, with wild imaginings
He fills my soul with so much love
That anywhere I go, I'm never lonely
With him along, who could be lonely?
I reach for his hand, it's always there

[Verse 4]
How long does it last?
Can love be measured by the hours in a day?
I have no answers now, but this much I can say
I'm going to need him till the stars all burn away
And he'll be there
```
