description: First experiences are critical. First impressions count but should you judge a book by its cover? Anyway, it seems we're always learning.

There are some key things to remember in life. You will learn something new every day until the frequency starts to decrease. Then you might learn something every week or every month. It depends if you read Wikipedia every day, in any case.

I’ll always remember that time when I first heard the word “babyface” to talk about someone who has the face of a baby. It never crossed my mind that someone grown-up could still have the face of an angel. When I look into my mirror, all I see is this: “gotta find a partner.”

What we’re going to do right here is go way back in time when the only words we knew were “daddy” and “mommy.” Four years ago, I found a code that put humanity in prison. Of course, it might be related to scrambled eggs, but it also could be our vocabulary.

How can you describe my daily life since the Lebanese Revolution? I guess drowsy is the best adjective to do it: HALF ASLEEP. Today I’m drinking ten coffees per day. Maybe it’s like a little adrenaline to get the heart going back on track until I met babyface (in the coffee shop I go to every day).

## How Do You Dress Up Like A Lovely Day?

I’ve had my share of lovely days and then some not so lovely ones. A typical beautiful day starts early most of the time. You’re going somewhere, and you know you will talk with some friends. You’re going to learn something today or maybe consolidate and get confirmation.

Late in the evening, you might meet some childhood friends of yours to play basketball on the computer. You know it might be painful a little because you might win or you might lose. But there should be revenge in case something terrible happens.

While commuting to school, work, or your friend’s house, you will listen to some music to do a little teleportation. You don’t want to face the physical environment around you, ultimately. Because there’s much corruption in the sky, you want to have positive vibes in the head. And that’s why I’m sharing this song and album with you today.

A lovely day should also include beautiful weather: one should be aware of winter or summer. At some point, the weather will have a minimal impact on you because you will have felt the warmth of solidarity. It’s the cold world, no doubt about it.

## Will You Be There For Me Like Before?

Friends will be friends. I know my friends will be there like they’ve been there before. Of course, sometimes, we quarreled over stupid things like being free from anxiety (aka security). That’s why I worked a lot to find a code to free humanity. The code might be that there is a code; this means the code is intimacy.

Everybody is looking for intimacy, and that may be why your body starts doing strange things as if you are at a party with a disco DJ. The song I chose is from the band U2, and they had their share of bodily complaints. Life on the road isn’t stable except maybe if you’re trying to forget your divorce and the emotional wreckage associated with it.

So how do you cope with a wide range of emotions? Should you write a song, an EP, an album, or make music your main job? Eric Clapton’s grief after the loss of his young son was expressed in only one song, and it took him 14 years to deal with the loss.

Only people who take risks know how painful loss can be. I guess we don’t have a choice and must be demanding. Tell me why there’s so much hurt on Earth!

## How Should I Treat An Ordinary Guy?

This question isn’t visible, and let me explain to you why I’m mentioning it. I’m meeting babyface regularly, and I wonder how I’m treating that person. I want to say she must represent the immensity of the Earth. Since I haven’t spent much time in nature since 2016, I’m genuinely impressed to be able to have a coffee and feel like I’m in a natural environment.

Mother Nature can do miracles like Mother Mary (the mother of Jesus). But I have news for you: I think the mother that will get us out of here is Mother KYE (Know Your Enemy). Sometimes nature can be cruel if you don’t respect her.

My enemy, at the moment, is trying to be an ordinary guy. After 20 years of hard work, I’m trying to digest 10,000+ songs and blog about it. I know I’m not the only one, but I think I have good taste. The reason I was an ordinary guy was that I needed to investigate something. But I forgot about the price of love and hate.

## How Do You Know That Person Is From A Distant Star?

To conclude, it’s clear that some people on Earth represent the cosmic race. I’m not talking about being natural, although it’s an important aspect. I’m talking about coming from a distant star system. I’m here to warn you that space people and UFO religions could become important in 2035.

The first time I learned about UFO religions, I was a little skeptical. I’m a big astronomy fan with a bit of dreamy music to light my day. But we need something to get over the fact that most of us have a hard time learning a new lesson every day.

Now you know the concept of babyface: it’s there to remind you some people rely on you to make their life better and protect them from severity and cruelty.

There are 12 forms of beauty down here, including grotesque and sublime. But I must say babyface can do wonder for your drowsiness. Now, you know something new. Lately, what have you learned, or what have you discovered?

I’ve got the blues before sunrise. I might be forever blue. But babyface is a hell of a stimulant!

```
[Verse 1]
Watching your bright blue eyes in the freeze frame
I've seen them so many times
I feel like I must be your best friend
You're looking fine, so fine
Dressed up like a lovely day

[Chorus]
Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Cover girl with natural grace
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?

[Verse 2]
Comin' home late at night to turn you on
Checkin' out every frame
I've got slow motion on my side
Turnin' around and around
With the sound and colour under my control
Round and around, goin' down
Dressed up like a lovely day

[Chorus 2]
Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Tinfoil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface, Babyface
Bitter-sweet girl, won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?
Babyface, Babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, Babyface
Open that door, let me unpack my case
Babyface, Babyface
You're everywhere, child, you're all over the place
Babyface, Babyface
You're comin' to me from outer space
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy?
```
