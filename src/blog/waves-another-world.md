Zeta Reticuli is a wide binary star system in the southern constellation of Reticulum. From the southern hemisphere, the pair can be seen with the naked eye as a double star in very dark skies. This system is located at a distance of about 39.3 light-years (12.0 parsecs) from Earth.

“The Zeta Ridiculi Incident.” What better place to share a silly tale of alien abduction, and bad journalism, than this music blog along with a carefully selected song?

During the 2012 Maya phenomenon, someone had claimed to be contacted by Zeta Reticuli aliens. While the possibility of alien life is still debated, one should try to understand why such claims can be made.

People have got to sell, and we need sensational news from outer space. But I guess the most thrilling story we have about space is that, 7 million years later, we’re still stuck on Earth.

## Immortal Until Today And That Cold Decay?

Perhaps the growing fragility of life made a magazine write a story about someone contacted by aliens. After all, there’s a UFO religion I won’t mention that warned us in 2035 aliens will come.

How come 7 million years later we’re still stuck? It’s only been 70 years since we ventured in the sky and returned someone safe from there. I guess we have the answer: I like to explore space and love, but I want to return safely from that trip.

Sadly, traveling creates a complex identity, and this is improbable one can return intact from a trip to the International Space Station. Even astronauts talked about seeing our strange rock from that point of view; they realize we are under the same sun, and our disputes seem very childish.

Is this the way we should remain? I’m talking about never feeling any pain and staying forever young.

## Is Exploring Billions of Galaxies a Reasonable Request?

You look to the sky, and you try to imagine what went through the mind of the creator. He/she might have been full of doubts and preferred making a generous present. It’s not that generous since you can evaluate the gift immediately: billions of stars and galaxies.

Moreover, the creator wanted to explore his creation in the long run. Before the Big Bang, people always were thinking about the short term. We might be a game of poker, then: We may have to show our cards one day in this significantly probabilistic universe.

What are the odds today I can heal from cancer? What are the odds this might only be AIDS? After all, I was born in 1980 during a time when there was an AIDS epidemic.

I’ve got some love for you if you were born in the ’80s. The golden age of porn still haunts me at a subconscious level.

## How Do You Feel Spending Another Day Without Her?

Readers of that blog know that I lost a friend in 1994 when she was 14 years old. It might have been more than a friend, I confess. And that might be why I’m seriously ill. Sometimes I think that because they took you, they might as well take me, too.

Since that moment, I rarely dreamt. I might have imagined as many as six times since 1994 (25 years). Recently, however, I had four dreams in a short span (of about two weeks). The dreams were all nightmares filled with agony.

I was full of life until the Big Bang. Like a humorist telling unusual jokes, I rode a metaphorical roller coaster. Now I can’t be close with an intimate partner.

I’m never there, and I’m living in the past. I’m like a butterfly caught in a hurricane. My horizon became a bit strange and touchy. And now, I’m giving my regard and opinion about the dodgy subject of space people and UFOs.

## I Won’t Stand Spending Another Day In Paris!

All in all, I don’t want to live in Paris anymore. I want to go back to Beirut, where I was born. The weather and architecture are more human. I know Paris was once again devastated by Alois Brunner and the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). This makes me think that half of humanity is seriously putting the Earth at risk of exploding.

Who will win the battle for power and domination? Men or women?

We know ancient people who made women empowered, such as the Nabateans. The Nabateans were an Arab people who inhabited northern Arabia and the Southern Levant in antiquity. Their settlements, most prominently the assumed capital city of Raqmu (present-day Petra, Jordan), gave the name of Nabatene to the borderland between Arabia and Syria, from the Euphrates to the Red Sea.

Is only the very best a reasonable request? Is exploring space and the billions of galaxies reasonable? Do we need third sex to judge the problems between men and women? One thing is certain, though: when I listen to music, I’m picking up waves from another world, and this is quite refreshing for someone who spent 27 years in Paris.

```
No one can have more than their due
I wanted life, I wanted you
Only the very best
A reasonable request

This is too high a price to pay
Now they've taken you away
Might as well take me

Down, down to hell for I don't care
They can put me anywhere
Throw away the key

I always walked a definite line
Cutting a dash, cutting it fine
And once, only once did I lose control
I gave her my soul
And I gave, and I gave, and I gave her my soul

I was immortal till today
Now I feel a cold decay
Crawling over me, over me

No one can have more than their due
I wanted life, I wanted you
Only the very best
No other interest

This is the way you should remain
Never feeling any pain
Never growing old

Sleep little one, your night is here
Mine is growing very near
Oh, it's getting cold
```
