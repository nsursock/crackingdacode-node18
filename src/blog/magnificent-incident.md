Occasionally, one grapples with the feeling of hopelessness, a tender snare. Consider the possibility of reuniting with someone precious; was an opportunity squandered?

Periodically, a sense of overwhelming despair pervades, akin to the ongoing conflict in the Middle East. It appears the victor is the one adept at dehumanizing the opposition in this information war.

Current events unfold with strife in Ukraine and Gaza, perpetuating cynicism since your youth, seemingly unaltered with age. For some, this remains an untenable perspective.

The apt approach to navigate the weight of such catastrophic events is to adopt a growth-oriented mindset. The looming question: Will the world witness the dawn of World War III? Patience remains the key. 

## Is historical revision necessary for clarity?

In light of the events on October 7th in Israel and Gaza, one might ponder the origins of this ongoing conflict. Feelings of culpability and shame may burden one faction in this conflict. Why does the enduring colonization persist as an accepted norm over decades?

Both sides have endured suffering, demonstrating an awareness of the costs involved. Nevertheless, this enduring power imbalance has given rise to decades of passive-aggressive behavior.

The Jewish connection to the land of Palestine, historically considered divine, is marred by their global dispersal as a form of divine punishment. It is believed that only with the return of Jesus can they reclaim the land of Israel.

The future remains uncertain. Only time can unravel who prevails, who remains, as each group pursues its own path.

## Curious about the lack of a simple escape?

Why did this conflict begin? Originally, it aimed to provide a safe haven for Jewish faith practice to escape persecution. But, should the Palestinians bear the loss of their homes and lands?

A stark reality, one I have observed, is that survivors, once liberated, sometimes adopt the traits of their oppressors, driven by a sense of empowerment.

It's disconcerting to see Jewish interests reminiscent of Nazi expansionism, discussing territorial conquests like the German concept of 'lebensraum' in 1939.

The enduring nature of this conflict? The lack of unified action among Arab nations. We often forget how history, the rise and fall of empires, has shaped our world. Post-Ottoman Empire, Palestine fell under British mandate.

## What prompts newspapers to assert the emergence of a new trend?

The events of October 7th have irrevocably transformed the Middle East, echoing the rhetoric of regional transformation akin to George Bush's stance in 2001. We are all too aware of the calamitous consequences of such an approach.

It appears evident that we are still grappling with the aftermath of the 2001 events and the War on Terror.

My perspective is rooted in personal involvement throughout the first decade of the 21st century in Europe, which I view as a lost era marked by internal struggles. The quest for a harmonious coexistence free from political infighting continues.

With the discovery of a code through music and free association, I hold hope that we can reverse the persistent desire to alter a Middle East that, despite its flaws including numerous dictatorial regimes, maintained a certain stability.

## You can thrive with power dynamics, or perish from them

All in all, the looming question is whether we are on the precipice of a global conflict. The BRICS nations, exemplified by China's deployment of ships to the Mediterranean, are flexing their geopolitical influence. Can we not aspire to a world devoid of warfare, guilt, and shame?

My personal narrative, and possibly that of many others, traces its origins to a schoolyard misunderstanding that left enduring emotional scars. This experience continues to weigh on me for two reasons: the profound impact of that moment and a sense of unfulfillment during those formative years.

The fixation on the Arab-Israeli conflict is not conducive to a healthy perspective, particularly when considering concurrent tragedies such as Afghanistan grappling with a devastating earthquake claiming 2,000 lives.

The future remains uncertain, but one enduring truth is the cyclical nature of human conflict. While some may find the spectacle of people in conflict magnificent, I find greater comfort in sipping a cup of coffee, indulging in a cigarette, and engaging in conversation.

[Intro]
Magnificent
Oh, oh, Magnificent

[Verse 1]
I was born
I was born to be with you
In this space and time
After that and ever after I haven't had a clue
Only to break rhyme
This foolishness can leave a heart black and blue

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar

[Verse 2]
I was born
I was born to sing for you
I didn't have a choice but to lift you up
And sing whatever song you wanted me to
I give you back my voice
From the womb my first cry, it was a joyful noise...

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
Only love, only love can leave such a mark
But only love, only love can heal such a scar
