title: Is Time A Powerful Ally 
title2: To Be Victorious?
description: Time may be on our side because it’s the judge. And if you’re a judge you’re always right even if you’re wrong. Which is why it's complicated.

That post could be about the difficult of judging but it’s about time and its perception.

Time dilation was already investigated by Einstein in his theory of relativity. I proposed a few months ago new laws for our universe: fluctuation, relaxation and perception. In that case, why some people deemed time was our judge and not our ally?

How can we measure what time brings to us? First let me remind you that, without time, there would be no music. Thanks to my French, Lebanese and English culture, we could conclude that time is a climate (time is called “temps”, ie climate in French).

The geologic time scale (GTS) is a system of chronological dating that relates geological strata (stratigraphy) to time. The primary defined divisions of time are eons. Eons are divided into eras, which are in turn divided into periods, epochs and ages.

The first step to understand the power of time is a simple one: look at nature and the beautiful environment time has created. What if time was like a river always looking for the sea?

## Time Is The Main Thing With Space Travels.

If time is like a river always looking for the sea, then we should try to understand where are the seas and oceans of time. For example, when we were young, summer and its 2 months of holidays was the main sea we were all waiting for.

Maybe, in that case, our main occupation is to spot those seas and oceans of time in our calendar. This summer I worked almost every day and I don’t know when I will have 2 months of holidays.

We must remember sometimes a shot can lead to a permanent vacation. What if death was the ultimate ocean or sea? This could mean we actively look for death. I know some people are fascinated.

## An Unbelievable Decade Spent On A Bad Obsession.

10 years have passed and they threaten the previous ten years. If our universe is 14 billion years old, then one can’t deny the fact that the perception of time is subjective. In the Bible, they mention people who lived almost 1000 years.

Phoenicia and the Byzantine Empire also lived 1000 years. Agreed there were good and bad times.

Children are those who fight time first and foremost. And maybe children will teach us that we need a little time before we mature completely in a stable human being able to navigate time and space.

If you have time for a bad obsession, make sure to get paid. But why did the Chicago Bulls used to say “what time is it” before a game?

## The Big Game Against Martians Is The Priority.

What if our time was limited? And what if it wasn’t? As the planets move around the Sun, we could imagine that Mars once was at the right distance of the star. What’s left of life on Mars if it once existed?

What if the adventures of humanity was about making a pause, contemplating the view and going forward with our excess baggage until the destination is reached?

Here we can see that time changed the game but we don’t care as long as we get some water. We need something to make it through the Solar system’s mud.

The human body is 66% water by weight, according to Hill and Kolb. Water is the universal solvent for life, referred to by Nobel Laureate A. Szent-Gyorgy as “the matrix of life”.That water serves as the solvent for sodium chloride (salt) and other substances so that the fluids of our bodies are similar to sea water.

## Time Is The Only Enigma With Love And Space.

We need time to reach other stars. Our nearest star is located 4 light years away which means we would need 4 years to travel from Earth to Proxima Centauri B. Why can’t we see time is our priority when it comes to essential things like love and space?

If time is like a climate, then music can create nice climates to spend some time in. Who can forget the climate in U2’s “One” song? It’s played a lot in marriages and Bono (U2’s singer) never understood why. Another nice climate is U2’s “With or Without You”.

Then maybe if want to stand the test of time (something that has produced a stunning environment), we must be able to create climates with songs. In this blog, songs are mainly jazz, blues, soul, rock, funk and electro (with a little bit of pop).

At the moment, my daily life is very simple: thunderstruck every day because of no help from anyone. Since thunder only happens when it’s raining, imagine the climate in my head: mostly dark clouds every day (even though I relocated in the Mediterranean).

Thank you France for your wonderful climate (oceanic degraded): it’s a curious climate with influences of the East. To stand the test of time, we need beautiful climates.

```
[Verse 1]
Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you, now
You got someone to blame?

[Chorus]
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
One love, we get to share it
Leaves you, baby, if you don't care for it

[Verse 2]
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth?
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without

[Chorus]
Well, it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One

[Verse 3]
Have you come here for forgiveness?
Have you come to raise the dead?
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head?

[Chorus]
Did I ask too much? More than a lot
You gave me nothing, now it's all I got
We're one, but we're not the same
Well, we hurt each other, then we do it again

[Bridge]
You say love is a temple, love a higher law
Love is a temple, love the higher law
You ask me to enter, but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt

[Chorus]
One love, one blood
One life, you got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life, but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
One

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh-ooh
May we, may we, may we get
Higher
Oh, higher
(Ay, yeah, go) higher
(Oh) Higher
```
