It is essential to engage in the contemplation of our universe's vastness to gain perspective on our place within the cosmos. Our galaxy, known as the Milky Way, is home to an estimated 100 to 400 billion stars and more than 100 billion planets, presenting a staggering array of celestial bodies.

In 2016, a significant revision in the count of observable galaxies was made, increasing the previous estimate from 200 billion to a breathtaking 2 trillion or more. This multitude of galaxies, with their combined luminosity, far surpasses the number of sand grains on our own planet.

The immensity of these numbers can evoke a deep sense of wonder, reminiscent of the 16th-century belief in Earth as the universe's center. We must now embrace the possibility of multiple universes, a concept actively discussed in contemporary scientific circles.

One might hypothesize that the Big Bang functions as a cosmic bridge, similar to the Bering Strait on Earth, potentially providing intermittent pathways to alternate universes through temporal gateways.

## How Did a Year in Los Angeles Shape My Future?

In the year 1999, at the age of 18 and fresh from completing my A-levels, I embarked on a two-month journey to Los Angeles, an opportunity presented by a close friend. This trip held special significance as it represented the last of my youth-centric adventures before stepping into adulthood.

While in Los Angeles, I pursued my interest in astronomy and hoped to delve into photography, though the latter was not to be due to class availability. Despite this, the experience culminated in a sense of personal growth and academic success, evidenced by a B+ in my astronomy course.

These formative experiences have since provided a solid foundation for my theoretical musings on the Big Bang. My academic journey was nearly halted by a borderline passing score in my A-levels, but this did not deter me from pursuing my intellectual passions.

It was during this pivotal year that I chose to remain in Paris, apart from my family in Beirut, foreseeing the city's potential for my personal and professional growth. This decision was underpinned by the confidence and knowledge gained through my studies.

## How Does Music Serve as a Mirror to Life's Journey?

The song '99' by Toto serves as a musical homage to George Lucas's film 'THX 1138', with its music video mirroring a scene from the movie where characters, dressed in white, navigate a stark white environment reminiscent of the film's setting.

Despite its success, Steve Lukather of Toto has expressed a distinct dislike for the song, describing it as 'obtuse'. The title '99' continues to be shrouded in mystery, but for me, the song's themes reflect my life's path since the year 1999.

The song encapsulates my growing confidence, the emotional distance from my family, and the intrigue surrounding a secretive space-related project. While initially a tribute, the song has become a personal anthem, representing significant life changes and the power of music to evoke a spectrum of emotions.

Another musical piece, 'Long Time Woman', highlights the impact music can have. Both songs illustrate the ability of music to resonate deeply and influence our perception of life's events.

## What Does It Mean to Challenge the Divine in Modern Times?

To embark on a journey that tests the limits of what is considered divine is not to engage in profane matters, but rather to push oneself to achieve great heights. Settling for mediocrity can be seen as a self-imposed limitation, which may border on self-sabotage.

The existence of divine entities remains unproven, but if they exist, they could be seen as a higher order that provides us with the means to excel. These entities may be watching, perhaps even guiding our endeavors to reach beyond what is ordinarily possible.

The song '99' by Toto, described as obtuse by the guitarist, seems to encapsulate the year that was so pivotal for me. Its themes relate to my decision to stay in Paris and the resulting journey that has shaped my life.

I have recently introduced a new product designed to inspire through words. It employs a method to reveal hidden meanings within words of 3 to 9 letters, offering insights into complex emotions and situations related to traits such as hubris.
