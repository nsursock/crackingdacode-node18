Our Milky Way galaxy, a celestial expanse that we call home, is believed to contain an astonishing number of stars and planets, with estimates ranging from 100 to 400 billion stars and over 100 billion planets.

A significant scientific breakthrough occurred in 2016 when the estimated number of observable galaxies increased from about 200 billion to a staggering 2 trillion, making the universe appear even vaster than previously believed.

The enormity of such figures can induce a profound sense of wonder, reminiscent of the 16th-century belief that placed Earth at the center of the universe. Today, we must embrace the concept that our universe may be one among many, possibly connected through the Big Bang event.

This hypothesis suggests that the Big Bang could be a cosmic bridge to other universes, much like the Bering Strait once connected different landmasses on Earth.

In the year 1999, at the age of 18 and fresh from my A-levels, I was presented with an opportunity to spend two months in Los Angeles, a trip that signified a transition into adulthood.

Despite not being able to enroll in a photography class due to full capacity, I devoted my time to studying astronomy, which instilled in me a deep-seated intellectual passion.

The culmination of this two-month educational endeavor resulted in a respectable B+ grade in astronomy, laying the groundwork for my future theories on the Big Bang.

With a barely achieved passing grade in my A-levels, I now seek to align my personal goals with the planet's trajectory, advocating for the betterment of our shared urban environments.

## What Can We Learn From the Mystique of the Song '99'?

The song '99', a tribute to George Lucas's 'THX 1138', features a music video that mirrors a scene from the film, depicting confinement and uniformity in a stark white setting.

Despite its success, guitarist Steve Lukather has expressed a strong dislike for the song, finding the lyrics to be particularly abstruse.

To me, the song's enigmatic title and themes resonate with my life's journey since 1999, reflecting a growing confidence, emotional distance from family, and involvement in a secretive space-related project.

Thus, '99' stands as an example of music's deep impact, carrying the power to reflect and influence our lives in myriad ways.

## How Do We Navigate Hubris in Pursuit of the Divine?

The quest to challenge divine forces does not pertain to the lascivious; it concerns the human drive to transcend mediocrity and avoid a life that borders on self-destruction.

While there is no empirical evidence to confirm the existence of divine beings, they may be perceived as a higher order that encourages our pursuit of excellence.

The controversial song by Steve Lukather, deemed obtuse, appears to me as a clear reflection of the important year 1999 and the life-altering decision to stay in Paris.

Recently, I introduced a new product designed to inspire through words, utilizing a unique method to reveal profound meanings hidden within our language.
