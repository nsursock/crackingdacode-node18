<p>You want to be productive. Make a piece of art that will stand out and resist the test of time. For me, the test of time is a test that has 3 synonyms: the test of the complex, the test of the dominant idea and, the test of the shadow.</p>

<p>I could explain in details what I mean but sometimes I like to think my readers understand what is my intention. Everybody knows about the test of time. New York couples still fight about it.</p>

<p>Once a label is on something, it’s no longer alive. That’s when positive labeling can be a life savior. For example, this blog is for all party people still a bit hungover.</p>

## How can you maintain productivity and creativity?

<p>No Blogging Duty Is Gonna Make Me Crawl</p>

<p>You have to have deadlines. They say time is money. But maybe it’s the complex things, the dominant ideas or the shadows at work that can give us money.</p>

<p>When I want to write something on my blog, I start listening to music. Or maybe think of a sentence in a song that I heard. Never thought about climate change.</p>

## What is the mission of your creative journey?

<p>Mission Of Mercy To The New Frontier</p>

<p>I almost gave up on that blog. I thought that nobody is able to recognize the talent. Although it is based on the music of the last 60 years. Which is based on the music of the last 200 million years?</p>

<p>That’s what I liked about the kind of music I listen to. It’s suspicious and seductive. Suddenly, I play funky licks that resemble classical music.</p>

## How can you overcome self-doubt and intolerance?

<p>They Will Overthink And Make You Feel Bad</p>

<p>Beginners should not be allowed outside. That might be why the Baiser Salé in Paris, France (a French jazz and soul palace) has a jam session for beginners on Sunday. Monday it’s for experienced people.</p>

<p>The first time I tried playing there, an Italian pianist whispered before we played: “during my solo, I don’t want to hear a sound from you”.</p>

## How does music influence your creativity?

<p>Listen to Good Music, Like Initials BB</p>

<p>OK, I’ll admit there’s another key to productivity. I think it’s called a diet. For example, are you a big fan of Schopenhauer? Or maybe Nietzche or Kierkegaard?</p>

<p>Once I read something from Schopenhauer that helped me I guess. He was saying that we should expect less and we will live a better life. What about Peter Kingsberry asking for “only the very best (a reasonable request)”?</p>

## How does motivation fluctuate in the creative process?

<p>In The Long Run, Motivation Fluctuates</p>

<p>For a strange reason, the world fluctuates. But I have the solution: it’s called the shadows. They are everywhere like the CIA or the FBI. Incredible how they have troubles with justice and modesty.</p>

<p>This a bit of a private joke but maybe the cold is related to aging. Anyway, the deadline for that blog is 2020. If I don’t get some water by then, I think I will go back to a normal lifestyle: when are the holidays?</p>

<p>Famous Last Words: Make The Best of the Situation</p>

<p>As a conclusion, a deadline is key when it comes to production. Of course, a proper diet (maybe an optimal diet) is also important. Production should be regular and of high quality.</p>

<p>My deadline was 750 words today. I have to write 1200 words though. Otherwise, Google will think my blog is worthless. My mindset was back to basics!</p>
