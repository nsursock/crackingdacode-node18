Although the concept of déjà vu is often discussed within a paranormal context, the mainstream scientific community firmly rejects notions of déjà vu as a form of 'precognition' or 'prophecy'.

Déjà vu is categorized into two distinct types: pathological déjà vu, which is typically linked to severe illnesses such as epilepsy, and the non-pathological déjà vu, more commonly experienced by healthy individuals. Frequent travelers and avid movie watchers are more susceptible to experiencing déjà vu.

Could the phenomenon of déjà vu be a manifestation of the human instinct for survival? The unfamiliarity of a person or situation may trigger a sense of recognition as a defense mechanism. Humans are adept at recognizing patterns, which can be beneficial, detrimental, or benign, depending on the circumstances.

## How Is Déjà Vu Connected to Psychological Pressure?

Déjà vu often occurs during moments of psychological fragility or intense pressure. Research indicates that the frequency of déjà vu experiences tends to decline with age.

In the context of a personal anecdote, the speaker recounts experiencing déjà vu upon unexpectedly encountering an ex-partner at a political rally, a situation that evoked past emotions and memories.

This unexpected meeting, where the speaker's ex-partner acted as if they were strangers, resulted in a profound sense of déjà vu, reminiscent of a love once felt and recognized.

## Is Déjà Vu Merely a Comfort in Solitude?

The occurrence of déjà vu may be influenced by one's surroundings, particularly when one is alone in a crowd. This solitary experience can prompt memories of previous encounters, thereby inducing déjà vu.

Society places a high value on self-restraint and composure, which can sometimes lead individuals to suppress their emotions. This tendency to appear nonchalant rather than enthusiastic may contribute to the reduction of déjà vu episodes as one grows older.

In such instances, it is speculated that déjà vu serves as a coping mechanism, a way for the mind to find familiarity and solace amidst the unfamiliar and isolating circumstances of life.

## Can We Choose to Dream or Shape Our Reality?

The concept of choosing between dreaming of love and pursuing it in reality is explored through the lens of a song. The ease of a task, such as loving, can lead to a sense of tranquility when one is adept at it.

The complexity of love is pondered, questioning whether it is inherently complicated or if it can be considered a simpler affair. The repercussions of viewing love as complex are considered, including the potential for controlling relationships or entanglements with friends and acquaintances.

To love and be loved is a profound experience, albeit occasionally marred by nightmares. The importance of mutual support in a relationship is emphasized, especially when faced with adversity.

The speaker reflects on a past relationship, acknowledging the different paths they and their partner were on, despite their shared time together.

## Why Do We Recall People but Forget the Context?

The final thoughts on déjà vu consider the importance of context in memory, as illustrated by a song reference. While the people involved in a déjà vu experience may be memorable, the context in which they are remembered is often overlooked.

This phenomenon may be yet another survival mechanism, intended to provide comfort during intense experiences that involve strong emotions. Without the appropriate means to express these emotions, such as through words, music, or art, they can become overwhelming.

Prehistoric humans left behind drawings of animals on cave walls, which today can evoke a sense of déjà vu in modern observers. This connection to the past highlights a form of collective memory and a shared experience of solitude.
