The avian chorus at dawn often resonates with a beauty that captivates the human ear, yet its true essence may elude our comprehension. These feathered creatures seem to be imparting an urgent message, a call to awaken and recognize the deceit woven through societal structures. Humans, engrossed in the melody, fail to discern the underlying plea for awareness, continuing as unwitting captives within an elaborate charade.

The true intent of this discourse, however, transcends ornithological communication. It delves into the realm of received messages and the battles waged with inner demons. At the tender age of fourteen, I encountered such a demon. The struggle was as real as the daily confrontations alluded to in the lyrical musings of the band Coldplay.

The influential concept that 'the medium is the message', as postulated by Marshall McLuhan, posits that the method of communication holds more significance than the content it conveys. Introduced in his seminal work, McLuhan suggests that a medium shapes and controls the scale and form of human association and action.

The notion of demons acting as messengers among humans compels us to consider their potential roles as manipulators of thought and will. The contemplation of this idea leads to a profound question: Is the true message of these entities a demonstration of the capacity to dominate the human mind?

This section examines the intersection of metaphysical influences and cognitive control, seeking to understand the depth of impact that unseen forces can have on our mental faculties.

The presence of demons in our lives is an inescapable reality, serving a purpose that is both enigmatic and profound. They come bearing messages, akin to the three little birds in song, yet their true challenge to us lies in patience: the duration of our endurance before serenity prevails.
