<p>A serious insight in the song “That Smell” by Lynyrd Skynyrd confirms that the real journey is within. The destination should be a safe distance and water.</p>

<p>I like to travel. Everybody loves it. What is your next destination? Mine is called retirement check. Because of the importance of rivalry and vengeance, you end up with a tunnel vision in the country surrounded by cows.</p>

<p>The main subject of that blog is to be vague enough so that people can relate but precise enough to show my personality. A climate and a chance for folks to meet. A journey where the destination is resting and digesting.</p>

## What is the Key to Loneliness?

<p>There’s too much parenting and grandparents also want to get involved. We gotta get out of this place because car honking is starting to make me nervous. Maybe the lightning also.</p>

<p>Also, finding your way through the rain and the steam is not an easy task when magnolia perfumes scream. When we were 21, we were going to take the world by storm.</p>

<p>Which we did but someone decided to spoil it. A journey many people can relate to I guess.</p>

## What Can Philosophy and Cocaine Teach Us?

<p>Cocaine decisions are like having a lover. Of course, partners are important during life but can you go on a holiday with cocaine? If you wanna hang out, you got to tell that drugs are bad.</p>

<p>Women’s liberation came creeping all across the nation and I fucked a dike named Freddie Mercury. Don’t get me wrong, I love Queen songs, but that kind of magic will be invalidated by the animal kingdom on a daily basis.</p>

## Can Poker Teach Us About Life?

<p>In poker, they have a term for an improbable odds: they call it a horror. That’s because, in the long run, this is not profitable. That may be the angel of darkness they talked about in the song.</p>

<p>I was experiencing philosophy like a fine wine. The moment was wonderful but the day after I was hungover. Maybe I don’t wanna get over.</p>

<p>What if the big bad world doesn’t owe me a thing? This journey doesn’t sound realistic because the cosmos watches us every day.</p>

## What Does Resting and Digesting Have to Do with Success?

<aside class="md:-ml-56 md:float-left w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

<p>The only line on the horizon is “father, where the fuck have you been?” Because resting belongs to lazy people doesn’t mean you shouldn’t rest to succeed.</p>

<p>In fact, resting and digesting is key to success. Suspicious minds still push the limits of my culture. I’m French and Lebanese and for some unknown reason, I’m good at English. Speaking a foreign language is a journey towards other people.</p>

<p>Until you play your life away in the middle of a civilized country. Zoo station was quite interesting, mainly because you meet all sorts in this line of work. Thank God cosmic debris can do something for us: you can make more money as a butcher.</p>

## What's the Joy of Jamming?

<aside class="md:-mr-56 md:float-right w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

<p>As a musician, I must say jamming is what is the most fun. Meeting fellow musicians on a daily basis and facing a small crowd is a wonderful experience. A journey I’ll never forget.</p>

<p>It’s true, 80% of the time it’s average but don’t we live for that 20%? A New York minute where a song exorcised the funk of 3 months. And though you try to tell yourself it wasn’t that good, your body starts to rejoice and feel relaxed.</p>

<p>You come home and start practicing your instrument like a madman laughing at WW2. I do think WW2 was a bad case of bad music: they kept talking about the blue note and had troubles with basic stuff like holding the neck of a guitar.</p>

## What's the Importance of Teamwork and Bonding?

<aside class="md:-ml-56 md:float-left w-full md:w-2/3 md:px-8">

<p>My retirement is unlikely. I remember that work is a wonderful experience. Maybe it’s just teamwork that’s interesting. After all, you get to meet all sorts and sometimes you meet someone like you. A journey worth nurturing.</p>

<p>Who can it be now, knocking on my neck and shoulders? I liked it here with my childhood friends. But it seems we have to grow up otherwise our lovers will take the ‘Hypocrite’ train.</p>

<p>That’s why Jammin’ Airlines is cool. Maybe no strings can secure you at the station. Ain’t talking about strippers. I’m talking about bonding and oxytocin (a peptide hormone and neuropeptide).</p>

## Can Sports and Adaptability Teach Us about Life?

<p>I always thought Germany had a great band with Scorpions. But now, I just learned they were eliminated in the group stage of the 2018 world cup. Soccer is a sport and, like in all things, they had a plan.</p>

<p>But the truth is that they didn’t adapt to their opponent. Stick to the plan and we will win. People don’t remember that a plan is only good if you are able to adjust with new information you get.</p>

<p>Germany was the defending champion and they got eliminated in the group stage (first stage). This is insane because you could expect from a defending champion to pass this stage.</p>

## What's the Destination for Life?

<p>As a conclusion, the Jammin’ Airlines had an announcement to make. The destination is a place where life is possible and liquid water is everywhere.</p>

<p>When you spend your time in laboratories trying to have a reaction from your surroundings, it can get exhausting. Because the only appropriate way to bother people is through art.</p>

<p>I might start a career in talent scouting. I know I have talent when I spot the talent in somebody. It’s as simple as that. It might be a bit naive but this position is too comfortable to be sustainable in the long run.</p>
