<p>Someone one day will raise the question of goto music when you don’t want to hide in the crunch. A safe bet? You have to float a little, and if it comes to you, listen to the song before time is up.</p>

<p>The number of songs today is gigantic, and music existed for at least thousands of years. There must be a reason for this, and it’s because the ear contributes to our balance. What’s worse than losing your balance?</p>

<p>I was wondering if I was on the right musical track and thought if I liked jazz, blues, soul, rock, and funk, I can’t go wrong. Of course, I want some heavy metal and electronic sounds. And some rap songs are worth listening to.</p>

<p>I guess at the core of all those styles are skilled musicians, that can set the roof on fire if you invite them to your party. If you can’t play your song in front of 50 people without ease, then I guess it’s terrible music.</p>

## Is It Wise to Play It Safe?

<p>When you play poker, and you start losing, the way to go is safe bets. That’s because you can’t afford to take those risks without jeopardizing your life or tournament. And that’s why I decided to leave Paris, France, for Beirut, Lebanon.</p>

<p>I should get 300 days of sun a year, but I must have left my heart somewhere. Will my dreams always be at the doorway of the house that Jack built? That was the main reason why Serge Gainsbourg and Brigitte Bardot broke up.</p>

<p>Lately, we had the same play when Thomas Langmann and Celine Bosquet broke up. Langmann is a French producer who produced “The Artist” with Berenice Bejo and Jean Dujardin (a Hollywood hit).</p>

<p>Don’t know if it’s a safe bet, but no one wanted to produce that film, and it became a critic and commercial success.</p>

## The Importance of Skill and Effort in Music

<p>Popular music is fresh, but only if the person behind the song is a skilled musician. Otherwise, I guess someone will commit a crime because I know the music industry sometimes has strange methods.</p>

<p>For example, if you promote something aggressively, people will start noticing it. After all, if it’s a hit, it’s healthy people talk about it. But 80% of the time, people feel like zombies and are highly influenceable.</p>

<p>That’s why, in this bright future, you can’t forget the past.</p>

<p>I’m a big Bob Marley fan, and I bought the best of his work. I might do the same with that blog and only highlight my top posts. But sometimes, inspiration is scarce.</p>

## Embracing Diversity in Music

<p>We all have that dream of living like a big family on Earth. Because our cousins on other planets will come back. Maybe in 2035, or maybe later.</p>

<p>What will happen is simple: they will ask for money. I know it because I’m asking for money. If you ain’t got no money, you ain’t no good.</p>

<p>Something simple is the key but not too simple. When you enter the world of music with five styles like jazz, blues, soul, funk, and rock, you have a solid foundation.</p>

<p>It’s like having five good friends to rely on in life.</p>

## Finding Identity and Self-Expression Through Music

<p>What I like about music is that you can fuse styles. And that’s what Carlos Santana did. He blended Latin music with modern flavors of jazz, blues, soul, rock, and funk.</p>

<p>Santana may be the only guitarist on Earth that you will recognize by playing one note. He found his sound (timbre) and never looked back. It makes me think that finding yourself may be the biggest challenge in life.</p>

<p>And the only way to do this is to avoid obsessions 90% of the time. Obsessed people never meet anybody and can’t find other obsessed people.</p>

<p>I used to stay at home a lot and listen to music. I could escape some grim and harsh reality like “I don’t belong here.” I wanted a perfect body, soul, and face. You never know who’s looking on.</p>
