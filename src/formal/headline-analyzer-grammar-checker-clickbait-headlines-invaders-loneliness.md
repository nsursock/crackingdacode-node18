Today, I want to conduct a test. It seems that 80% of people won’t read past the headline. That’s why I’m going to write great headlines, with a shallow copy in the paragraphs. By the way, the headline of that post got a green 71 score on Coschedule’s Headline Analyzer.

It helps if you have great headlines to catch people’s attention. It seems most of us are lost in a sea of misery because life is trying to play a game on us.

Maybe they’re asking for mercy? What this means is that this mission of kindness might be humanity’s last frontier: giving thanks every day because the present is a gift. The past makes you nervous; the future makes you stressed.

I’m not that obliged to write something stupid. Since most of my inspiration comes from jazz, blues, soul, rock, funk, and electronic music, I will always sound interesting. Now, I have a grammar checker called Grammarly, making sure that my writing is correct, clear, and engaging.

I’m giving up 2 important secrets today: the headline analyzer and the grammar checker. Since then, my writing has been better. But I have to go through two years of blogging to correct my past posts.

## Will you feel shame when you review the 300 previous posts?

I have to make a blog audit; I have to review two years of blogging and three hundred posts. If I can improve one article every thirty minutes, it will take me twenty days to have my music blog up to date with fantastic grammar, exciting clarity, extensive comments, and impressive realism.

My first posts are a bit hesitant: I wanted to rank high on Google but couldn’t write two thousand words every day. Even my audience was complaining it was too long, and they didn’t read (TL;DR).

The first time I stumbled upon TL;DR, I couldn’t believe it: there was a shortcut I didn’t know on the internet. ROFL LMAO—do you know what that means? (rolling on the floor, laughing my ass out.)

Recently, there was a post on Facebook saying California was the best region to live in. People there seldom moved to another place. I then commented with a verse from Hotel California (The Eagles): “you can check out, but you can never leave.”

## How do you see the world and yourself in 3 months?

This is a typical interview question: How do you see yourself in 2, 5, 10, or 30 years? I don’t know what to say exactly, but I could settle for having 1000 daily visitors on this music blog. Of course, 800 of them will only have read the headline. And then you wonder why people create clickbait headlines.

How strange has this world become? Are people that lazy and selfish? Or do most people think vaguely to invaders every day? It could be a friend on Facebook, your children, or a coworker who came to verify that you’re valuable to the company.

I was in a restaurant recently and was listening to the conversation of 3 businessmen. They were saying that “The world has changed and some people didn’t understand it.” The days are over when the workplace was a butchery, and it’s time for an era with more solidarity instead of competition.

I discovered a marketing firm recently that explained that they deployed their techniques in over 400 niches, generating a lot of revenue for their clients. I must say that they seem legit, and I have decided to rely on them for marketing this blog.

## What’s my high-value offer today?

This is the last paragraph that will have important news. In 200 words, we will try to come up with an excellent conclusion, even though no one will read it.

Today, my offer is simple: if you read more than the headlines, you can discover a thing or two, like a headline analyzer or a grammar checker. You could also find out how to use your culture in a social context to sound like you did your homework.

You will also learn about how to get into people’s heads as if you were a criminology pro. People might be lazy or selfish because they have to deal with invaders every day.

There’s only one way to deal with having to face invaders: evaluate your options. Most invaders will work like cancer, and you will have intrusive thoughts. Please make sure to think about something else fast. That may be why I write this blog: readers will have an easy time dealing with invaders.

## Is there someone still pretending to be a grown-up?

All in all, we might be pretending to be grown-ups. Still, our childhood reminds us clearly that the excitement of life resides in simple things, like taking a walk in nature or taking a boat to Cyprus. At the same time, the Civil War is still going on.

I was born in Beirut in 1980, and in my first memory, there was an awful bombardment. Would you wear an armband to support the man who said, “This music blog could save lives, and peace could last forever”?

It seems as if war might be about cleanliness, and sadly, it looks like, according to some Israeli representative, “there’s no clean war.” If the music I’m sharing on that blog can make you feel fresh and clean, then we can live in a perfect world without war.

Then the Earth can become the model we’ve all been waiting for while we expect to receive confirmation that we’re not alone in the universe. The violence on Earth could be due to our isolation in the cosmic concert. Loneliness is a very violent experience, but you could say it’s also about propriety.

What happens when this loneliness won’t leave you alone? Should you take the stairs if the social elevator is out of order?
