<p>In marketing, reaching people is crucial, but there's always a stage where some are lost. For instance, if my landing page with powerful messages fails to engage you, it might be unlikely to convert you.</p>

<p>The funnel represents a journey, similar to a trip, with the desired destination being a significant return on investment. As a marketer, I aim for big profits, and you, as a customer, should be proud of having a valuable experience.</p>

<p>Relationships can also be compared to a funnel. At first, there's intrigue, but over time, the effort and connection might fade away. Eventually, you might find yourself familiar with the cycle, saying 'I know the scene so well!'</p>

## Is life a journey or a destination?

<p>Life's journey is a combination of experiences, both positive and negative. If your path involves begging, stealing, and borrowing, it's understandable to feel disheartened. Selling advice like 'the best you can do is fall in love' might seem futile. However, when you encounter a person willing to share their heart, you can sell their cherished memories.</p>

<p>This is the true story of someone who aspires to make a living by exploring life day and night. Without routine, there would be no room for adventure. Brigitte Bardot, during her first marriage, engaged in two affairs and later dedicated her life to defending mishaps and failures.</p>

<p>The concept of a 'ground floor experience' or a funnel becomes apparent. As time passes, you may find yourself losing everything you fought for, akin to how some friends were surprised by treachery and betrayal over a conversation about puppets.</p>

## Is faking it the path to happiness?

<p>Psychology often advocated for the notion of 'fake it 'til you make it.' However, this blog, grounded in 60 years of good music, should eliminate any doubts about living authentically. If it fails to do so, there's a problem.</p>

<p>In other words, only 10% of individuals truly evolve. We used to depict humanity's journey as a straight line towards self-improvement. However, the truth is, if you possess talent, you have the right and duty to stand tall.</p>

<p>Behind statistics lies a complex reality. For instance, when a fan going through a divorce requests a 'love pricer,' I'm aware of two methods: Black-Scholes and Binomial Trees. Perhaps Monte Carlo nights could involve pricing.</p>

## Does freedom lose its meaning without the absence of tyranny?

<p>Swingers, those who enjoy life to the fullest, often make others work while they relax. However, one perversion of modern society is forgetting our ancestors. Solidarity and inventions were once prevalent, and mastering fire was a significant advancement for humanity. Maybe mastering the fire within ourselves is a daily battle.</p>

<p>In a work setting, reporting to someone else can be challenging. For instance, how can we report 3000 deaths during Hurricane Maria while money is too tight to mention? The importance lies in recognizing that freedom loses its essence when tyranny prevails.</p>

<p>Listening to songs in the Lydian mode becomes crucial when facing tyranny. It guarantees satisfaction and might prompt a future post against tyranny. The Middle East is currently in turmoil, where Lebanon resisted for a long time before seeking protection from Syria. Resisting both Israel and Syria for an extended period was nothing short of a miracle.</p>

## Are dreams and fantasies a reflection of reality?

<p>Some people can immediately reveal their true intentions with a deceptive smile. They enjoy life to the maximum while making others work for them. Unfortunately, modern society often forgets about our ancestors, who valued solidarity and innovation. Mastering fire was a significant milestone for humanity, and perhaps mastering the fire within our souls remains a daily struggle.</p>

<p>Is there a better way of life where people work for you? When you work for someone else, you become accountable to them. How can we address issues like 3000 deaths during Hurricane Maria when financial constraints prevent action?</p>

<p>The prophecy has spoken. As a self-proclaimed junkie seeking new experiences, I search for answers that will enable me to leave France and figure out why I can't escape the 16th district of Paris. While I anticipated an easy journey, comedy reigns supreme in France. Perhaps Paris should emphasize the importance of sports. Engaging in activities like yoga and pilates allowed me to feel in control of my body.</p>

## Is there a restorative power in easy moments?

<p>In Lebanon, France holds influence, just as Iran and the USA do. Thankfully, music allows us to embark on a cheap journey to distant lands. Listening to Carlos Santana's fusion of rock and Latin music is a personal favorite.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the humorous funnel might not be as amusing as initially thought. Was it merely a dream? Did someone mention it?</p>
